/**
 * Let's define a collection equilibrium element in a finite ordered collection X={x , x . .., x }
 * such that the sum of values to the left and to the right of it (non-inclusive) are equal.
 * In other words, the collection is said to have a collection equilibrium element if there is such position
 * i in X (1≤i≤N) where x +x ...x = x +x ...x Please implement the function collectionEquilibrium to return 0
 * if there is no such value and 1 if there is at least one such value. Note: The sum of values to the left of the leftmost
 * element and to the right of the rightmost element is 0.
 *
 * Constraints
 *      1 ≤ N ≤ 10
 *      1 ≤ X ≤ 2x10 where 1 ≤ i ≤ N
 *
 * Input Format
 *      The first line contains a single integer N, the number of elements in collection x. The next N lines for each
 *  test case contains N integers which are ordered elements of the collection x.
 *
 * Output Format
 *      return 1 if the input contains a collection equilibrium element and 0 if it does not.
