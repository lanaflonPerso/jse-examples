Big O
=====

A big collection of data structures and algorithms puzzles.

Problem statements are specified as Javadoc at the top of every solution. I have tried to be as descriptive as I can, but if something is not clear then please do let me know!
Problems are broadly classified into the following categories which are self explanatory.
